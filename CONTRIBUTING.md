# Contributing Guidelines

Apart from following [BIP 2](./bip-0002.mediawiki),
we do CI checks to ensure that the proposed BIPs do not have common typos.
These checks are done using [`typos`](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos).
To check for typos locally,
install [`typos`](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos)
and then run in the root directory:

```bash
typos
```
